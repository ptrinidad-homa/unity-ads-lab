    # Introduction

    This is the API documentation for the Unity Advertising Management API version 1 that allows
    you to programmatically manage your advertising campaigns through a RESTful API. The API currently offers endpoints
    that allow you to:

    * Manage <a href="#tag/Apps">Apps</a>
    * Manage <a href="#tag/Campaigns">Campaigns</a>
    * Manage <a href="#tag/Bids">Bids, Source Bids and Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) Bids</a>
    * Manage <a href="#tag/Budgets">Budgets</a>
    * Manage <a href="#tag/Creatives">Creatives</a> and <a href="#tag/Creative-Packs">Creative Packs</a>

    ## Getting Started

    To get started, you will first need to create a service account and assign suitable roles for it. The
    <a href="#section/Authentication">authentication section</a> has instructions for creating service accounts as well
    as for adding suitable authentication headers to your API requests. Note that you must be an Organization
    [Owner](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OrgsManagingyourOrganization.html) to manage service accounts.

    The <a href="#section/General-Information">general information section</a> describes shortly the entities found in
    the API, their relationships as well as the resource IDs used in the API.

    The <a href="#tag/Apps">endpoint section</a> contains documentation for the actual API endpoints.

    The API endpoints are hosted at the following base URL: `https://services.api.unity.com`.

    **How to Gain Access?**

    **Note**: To be able to access the API and to create service accounts, your organization needs to have access granted
    to the Advertising Management API. Please contact
    your Unity Client Partner or email us at unityads-support@unity3d.com.

    ## API Versioning

    The APIs are versioned by having a version number as a part of the endpoint URL. The API may receive non-breaking
    changes without its version number being changed. Breaking changes are introduced only to new API versions.

    Non-breaking changes can include (but are not limited to) for example:

    * Adding new optional request headers
    * Adding new fields to the response
    * Adding new status codes to the response status codes list
    * Changing a required field to be optional
    * Changes to rate limits
    * Under-the-hood fixes that don’t change the URL signature, the request format or the response format

    Breaking changes can include (but are not limited to) for example:

    * Changing the URL signature
    * Removing a field from the response
    * Adding a new required field to the request

    ## Deprecation Policy

    If a newer version of the API is released or if the service is discontinued, the API or one of its versions may be
    deprecated and eventually shutdown.

    Deprecation of an API version will occur in 2 steps:

    1. Unity's client partner or support team will email Organization owners, informing them of the new version's imminent
       release and the current version's deprecation date. A deprecation notice will appear on the HTTP headers of any
       deprecated API, and the documentation will be updated as such.
    2. After 3 months of continued support for a deprecated version, Unity may cease support or shut down the version
       entirely. A complete shutdown notice will be sent 1 month in advance.

    # General Information

    ## Entity Relationships

    This section provides an overview on what the different resources in the API are and how they relate to each other.

    At the top level, the API has a resource that is called `App`. The `App` resource corresponds to a single app/game
    that has been published in a single app store. If you have published your app/game in more than one app store then
    you will have a separate `App` resource for each of those stores. Note that it is also possible to have more than one
    `App` resources that correspond to the same app/game in a store. The following diagram visualizes this relationship
    for a game called `My Game`:

    ```mermaid
      graph TD

      StoreApp1(My Game for Platform X) --- AdsApp1
      StoreApp2(My Game for Platform Y) --- AdsApp2

      subgraph App Store 1
        StoreApp1
      end

      subgraph App Store 2
        StoreApp2
      end

      subgraph Unity Ads
        AdsApp1(App) --- Resources1-1("...")
        AdsApp1 --- Resources1-2("...")
        AdsApp1 --- Resources1-3("...")

        AdsApp2(App) --- Resources2-1("...")
        AdsApp2 --- Resources2-2("...")
        AdsApp2 --- Resources2-3("...")
      end

      classDef grey fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef white fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef green fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef blue fill:#1e60ab,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;

      class Resources1-1,Resources2-1 blue
      class Resources1-2,Resources2-2 green
      class Resources1-3,Resources2-3 red
    ```

    Apps contain advertisement campaigns and resources related to those campaigns such as bids and creatives:

    ```mermaid
      graph TD

      subgraph Unity Ads
        App ---|has| Creative("Creative (Video, Playable or End Card)")
        App ---|has| CreativePack(Creative Pack)

        CreativePack -.-|uses| Creative
        Campaign -.-|uses| CreativePack
        Campaign --- Bid(CPI bids and Source Bids)
      end

      classDef white fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef green fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;

      class App white
      class Campaign,Bid blue
      class Creative,CreativePack green
    ```

    Apps hold also further configuration that is utilized by the campaigns, such as budgets:

    ```mermaid
      graph TD

      subgraph Unity Ads
        App(App) ---|has| Budget(Budget)
        App(App) ---|has| Campaign(Campaign)
        Campaign -.-|uses| Budget
      end

      classDef white fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef green fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef blue fill:#1e60ab,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
      classDef red fill:#f33,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;

      class App white
      class Campaign blue
      class Budget red
    ```

    ## Resource IDs Used in the API Calls

    To identify your organization as well as its apps and campaigns we use the following identifiers:

    * **organizationId**: identifies your organization
    * **campaignSetId**: identifies your app (collection of campaigns) within your organization
    * **campaignId**: identifies a single advertising campaign within your app

    ### How to Look Up organizationId

    To look up the `organizationId`, please use the following steps:
    1. Open the [Acquire Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/acquire)
    2. Select **Settings** from the navigation.
    3. On the settings page, you will see two separate Organization ID fields. For the Advertising Management API, pick
    the value from the `Organization Core ID` field.

    **Note**: The organizations are identified with two separate identifiers due to legacy reasons. The full name of the
    organization identifier used in the Advertising Management API is `Organization Core ID` but due to practical reasons
    it has been shortened to be `organizationId` in this API documentation.

    ### How to Look Up campaignSetId and campaignId

    To look up the `campaignSetId` and `campaignId`, the following options are available:

    Apps and their respective campaignSetIds can be retrieved using the [List Apps](#operation/advertise-listApps)
    endpoint. In the API response, the `id`-field holds the campaignSetId. Likewise, campaigns and their respective
    campaignIds can be retrieved using the [List Campaigns](#operation/advertise-listCampaigns) endpoint.

    The campaignSetId and campaignId identifiers are also available via the [Advertising Statistics API](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/stats-api)
    where you can find them under the columns `campaign set id` and `campaign id`, respectively.

    It is also possible to find all the identifiers from the URLs of the Unity Acquire dashboard. First, open the
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/acquire/) and then click **Apps** and choose an app and a campaign to view.
    After that the IDs are visible in the URL in following spots:
    `https://dashboard.unity3d.com/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/acquire/campaign-sets/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>`

    ## Rate Limits

    The API has rate limiting in place. The maximum number of requests per IP address is limited to 6 requests per
    second and to 4000 requests per 30 minutes.

    Additionally all operations that modify resources (`PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) are limited so that it is possible to modify
    a single resource per endpoint at most 30 times per 30 minutes or at most once per a second. This means that for example
    the CPI bids of a single campaign can be updated at most 30 times inside a 30 minute time interval. The endpoints
    don't share the quota, so it is possible to do also other updates (e.g. source bids) to that same campaign during that
    same time interval.

    Similarly operations that create resources (`POST`) are limited so that it is possible to create at most 30 new
    resources per endpoint under a single app or campaign per 30 minutes or at most once per a second. This means that
    it is possible to for example upload at most 30 creatives into a single app within a 30 minute interval.
    During that same time window it is possible to also create other resources or apply updates to the campaigns that
    are under the app. Each endpoint has its own quota.

    If you need to update multiple campaigns fast, you can do that. It is for example possible to update CPI bids of hundreds
    of campaigns within a short time interval, as long as the number of requests stays in the overall bounds of max 6 requests
    per second and max 4000 requests per 30 minutes.

    The API responds with `429` HTTP status code if the rate limit is exceeded.

    ## Response Compression

    The API supports response compression. The responses are compressed if either `Accept-Encoding: gzip` or
    `Accept-Encoding: deflate` header is provided in the request.

    Example:
    ```
    curl -H "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/5772680389521/apps/5ee23a52c10f9455722a5ead/campaigns/5ee23a557de7e87ee0958dfc/source-bids
    ```

    ## Uploading and Assigning Creatives

    Creatives and creative packs are the content of your ad campaigns. This article covers the following steps:

    * [Overview](#section/Guides/Creatives/Overview)
    * [Step 1: Upload Your Creatives](#section/Guides/Creatives/Step1)
    * [Step 2: Create a Creative Pack](#section/Guides/Creatives/Step2)
    * [Step 3: Assign a Creative Pack to a Campaign](#section/Guides/Creatives/Step3)

    ### <a name="section/Guides/Creatives/Overview"></a>Overview

    The ad assets (files) such as videos, playables and end cards are managed using two concepts called
    `Creatives` and `Creative Packs`. Creatives directly hold your creative files while creative packs combine 1-3
    creatives into a pack that can be assigned to one or more campaigns.

    The process for creating and assigning creative packs to campaigns is as follows:

    ```mermaid
      graph LR
      Upload[Upload creatives] --> Pack[Create a creative pack] --> Assign[Assign the creative pack<br>to a campaign]
      classDef black fill:#000,color:#fff,stroke:#ddd,stroke-width:1px,line-height:21px;
      class Upload,Pack,Assign black
      click Upload "./advertise.html#operation/advertise-createCreative"
      click Pack "./advertise.html#operation/advertise-createCreativePack"
    ```

    ### <a name="section/Guides/Creatives/Step1"></a>Step 1: Upload Your Creatives

    You can upload your creatives by using the [Create Creative](#operation/advertise-createCreative) endpoint.

    The following creative assets can be uploaded currently through the API:

    * **Square end card**: this creative type contains a single square shaped 800 × 800 image.
    * **End card pair**: this creative type contains a 600 × 800 portrait image and a 800 × 600 landscape image.
    * **Portrait video**: this creative type contains a 9:16 portrait video.
    * **Landscape video**: this creative type contains a 16:9 landscape video.
    * **Playable**: this creative type contains an MRAID 2.0 compliant HTML document in a landscape, portrait or responsive orientation. [See full playable guidelines](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide#playables).

    Usually you call the `Create Creative` endpoint once for each file you wish to upload. The only exception to this is
    the end card pair creative which includes both portrait and landscape images in one creative.

    #### Upload a Video

    Below is an example how the upload endpoint can be called using the command line command `curl`. To try
    it out, replace the `/path/to/your/file/myPortraitVideo.mp4` with your local video file path and replace
    `<ORGANIZATION_ID>`, `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>` and `<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>` with values matching your organization and app.

    ```
    curl --verbose \
         --form 'creativeInfo={"name": "My Portrait Video", "language": "en", "video": {"fileName":"myPortraitVideo.mp4"}}' \
         --form "videoFile=@/path/to/your/file/myPortraitVideo.mp4" \
         --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
         https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives
    ```

    Once the upload has completed successfully, you will receive a HTTP `201` response with a response payload such as below:

    ```JSON
      {
        "id": "5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1",
        "name": "My Portrait Video",
        "language": "en",
        "type": "portraitVideo",
        "createdAt": "2020-12-11T12:19:29.004Z",
        "status": "uploaded"
      }
    ```

    #### Upload a Square End Card

    Uploading a square end card works in similar fashion as uploading videos but you'll need to adjust the request
    in the following way:

    1. Adjust the `creativeInfo` to contain a `squareEndCard` field instead of a `video` field.
    2. Instead of passing the file in a `videoFile` field, pass the file in a field called `squareEndCardFile`.

    Example:
    ```
    curl --verbose \
         --form 'creativeInfo={"name":"My End Card", "language":"en", "squareEndCard": {"fileName":"mySquareEndCard.jpeg"}}' \
         --form "squareEndCardFile=@/path/to/your/file/mySquareEndCard.jpeg" \
         --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
         https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives
    ```

    #### Upload an End Card Pair

    Uploading an end card pair works in similar fashion as uploading videos and square end card but you'll need to
    include both end card files in the request:

    ```
    curl --verbose \
       --form 'creativeInfo={"name":"My End Card Pair", "language":"en", "portraitEndCard": {"fileName":"myPortraitEndCard.jpeg" }, "landscapeEndCard": {"fileName":"myLandscapeEndCard.jpeg"}}' \
       --form "portraitEndCardFile=@/path/to/your/file/600x800.jpeg" \
       --form "landscapeEndCardFile=@/path/to/your/file/800x600.jpeg" \
       --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
       https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives
    ```

    #### Creative Status

    After having been uploaded, all new creatives undergo a [content moderation process](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide#moderating-creatives)
    to ensure that they adhere to Unity's advertising [content policies](https://unity3d.com/legal/advertising-content-policy).
    Before entering the moderation queue the video creatives go through a processing state that can take few minutes.

    You can check the latest status of the uploaded creative with [Get Creative](#operation/advertise-getCreative) endpoint.

    Creatives can be added into a creative pack immediately after they have been uploaded. It isn't necessary to
    wait for the moderation to complete. However, a creative pack can go live only after all its creatives have
    passed the moderation.

    ### <a name="section/Guides/Creatives/Step2"></a>Step 2: Create a Creative Pack

    Once you've uploaded your creatives, you can use [Create Creative Pack](#operation/advertise-createCreativePack)
    endpoint to create a creative pack out of them. A creative pack combines 1-3 creatives into one entity
    that can be assigned to one or more campaigns.

    The following creative combinations are allowed when creating a creative pack through the API:

    * Portrait video  + end card
    * Landscape video + end card
    * Portrait video  + landscape video + end card
    * Responsive playable
    * Portrait playable
    * Landscape playable
    * Portrait playable + landscape playable

    While only one video or playable is required, uploading one for each orientation yields better optimization.
    When a creative pack contains both, Unity’s valuation algorithm selects the best orientation to display.

    Below is an example that creates a creative pack that contains one portrait video (with ID `5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1`)
    and one square end card (with ID `5feb40a6ff3d91a3af53c678`):

    ```
    curl --verbose \
         --request POST \
         --data '{"name": "Portrait video with square end card", "creativeIds": ["5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1", "5feb40a6ff3d91a3af53c678"], "type": "video"}' \
         --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
         --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
         https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creative-packs
    ```

    Replace the `creativeIds`, `<ORGANIZATION_ID>`, `<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>` and `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>` with values that match your app and organization.

    For a successful request, the response HTTP status code is `201` and the response body follows following format:

    ```JSON
    {
      "id": "5feb4574ff3d91a3af53c67e",
      "name": "Video with end card",
      "type": "video",
      "creativeIds": [
          "5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1",
          "5feb40a6ff3d91a3af53c678"
      ]
    }
    ```

    ### <a name="section/Guides/Creatives/Step3"></a>Step 3: Assign a Creative Pack to a Campaign

    To assign a creative pack to your campaign, use the <a href="#operation/advertise-assignCreativePack">assign Creative Pack endpoint</a>.

    If your creative pack's ID is for example `5f15703772f10b00138f6d8d`, you can assign it to your campaign with a POST
    request:

    ```
    curl --verbose \
         --request POST \
         --data '{"id": "5f15703772f10b00138f6d8d"}' \
         --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
         --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
         https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/assigned-creative-packs
    ```

    The currently assigned creative packs can be listed with a GET query:

    ```
    curl --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
         https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/assigned-creative-packs
    ```

    The response contains a list of creative pack IDs.

    A campaign must contain at least one approved creative pack in order to go live. If your live campaign includes a
    mix of approved and pending creative packs, the pending ones will automatically run once approved.

    To unassign a creative pack from a campaign, use the <a href="#operation/advertise-unassignCreativePack">unassign Creative Pack endpoint</a>.

    You can unassign a creative pack with a DELETE query that includes the creative pack's ID in the URL:

    ```
    curl --verbose \
         --request DELETE \
         --header "Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>" \
         https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/assigned-creative-packs/<ASSIGNED_CREATIVE_PACK_ID>
    ```

        <h4>Note about iOS Campaigns</h4>

        All campaigns are now billed by Cost per Impression (CPM).

        This is a billing method where you are charged based on the total number of impressions your campaign receives.
        This means that CPI campaigns are now [target CPI campaigns](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/advertising#what-is-target-cpi-)
        while your campaign optimization goals, such as Installs, ROAS or Retention, do not change. You can learn more
        about this billing type [here](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/advertising#what-is-cost-per-impression-billing-).

        Bids are now Target CPI (tCPI) bids, the average amount you wish to pay per install. Target CPI is a bidding
        strategy that sets bids to help you get as many conversions as possible within a tight range of the target
        cost-per-install you set. This strategy automatically optimizes bidding for your ad each time it is eligible to
        appear. Target CPI (tCPI) bids are set the same way as CPI bids via APIs.

  - name: Budgets
    description: |
      Manage your campaign budgets with these APIs.

      Your campaign budget dictates how much marketing spend your campaigns could consume.

      A budget is first created and then assigned to the desired campaigns. If a budget is assigned to multiple campaigns
      then all of those campaigns consume that same budget. By default a campaign does not have a budget assigned to it,
      meaning that by default a campaign has an **unlimited** budget.

      Budget has an overall limit for marketing spend of a campaign and it can also have a daily cap.

      Unity recommends a minimum campaign budget of $2,000 and a daily budget of $500 per country. Campaigns with less
      than $1000 total budget and $500 daily limit per country might not get any exposure due to budget restrictions.

      Having a low daily limit might result in overspend during the first few days, as the system might not be able to
      accurately predict the performance of your campaign.

      **Note**: The budget limit serves as a rough estimate. Unity does not guarantee to invoice you according to the
      budget limit amount.

      <div style="background-color: #b38629; color: white; padding: 1em; padding-top: 1em; font-size: 1em;">
        Support for shared budgets will be removed in Fall 2022. If you are sharing budgets between any campaigns, please consider moving to using a single budget per campaign. You can do so by creating a new budget for the campaign. Note that some features may not be available for campaigns using shared budgets.

        Upload an end card or video creative using this endpoint.

        Three different types of creatives can currently be created through this API:

        * **Square end card**:  a single square shaped 800 × 800 image.
        * **End card pair**:  a 600 × 800 portrait image and a 800 × 600 landscape image.
        * **Video**:  contains either a 9:16 portrait video or a 16:9 landscape video.
        * **Playable**: contains an MRAID 2.0 compliant HTML document in a portrait, landscape or responsive orientation. [See full playable guidelines](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide#playables).

        Each creative type requires a slightly different JSON payload and a different set of binary files:

        * one image file for a square end card,
        * two image files for an end card pair,
        * one video file for a video creative.
        * one HTML file for a playable creative.

        To create a creative, you will need to send a HTTP request with content type of `multipart/form-data`
        to the API endpoint. The first part of the multipart form should contain a field named `creativeInfo` that
        contains JSON metadata about the creative, followed by one or more additional parts containing the binary
        data for each creative file.

        **Example**

        For a square end card the raw HTTP request could look for example following:
        ```
        POST /advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives HTTP/1.1
        Host: services.api.unity.com:443
        Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>
        Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=--------------------------371131627955007232942795
        Content-Length: 51165
        ----------------------------371131627955007232942795
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="creativeInfo"
        Content-Type: application/json

        {
          "name": "My Creative",
          "language": "en",
          "squareEndCard": {
            "fileName": "myCreative.jpeg"
          }
        }
        ----------------------------371131627955007232942795
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="squareEndCardFile"; filename="myCreative.jpeg"

        <IMAGE_BINARY_DATA>
        ----------------------------371131627955007232942795--
        ```

        Notice that the place holders `<ORGANIZATION_ID>`, `<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>`, `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>` and `<IMAGE_BINARY_DATA>` need to be replaced with valid values.

        When uploading creative assets, please observe Unity’s advertising content policy. [Read more](https://unity3d.com/legal/advertising-content-policy)

        A continuous data flow is expected when uploading the file. The creative upload is allowed to take at most 5 minutes.
        This means that if you are creating a creative that contains a video that has the maximum file size of 100 MB then your average upload speed must at least 2.7 Mbps.
        If the upload takes longer than 5 minutes then the request will fail.  If the upload halts (no bytes are transferred) for over 30 seconds then the request will fail.

        If the same files have already been uploaded as part of a previous creative, the existing creative is returned and no new one is created.

        Three different types of creative packs can be currently created through this API:

        * **video**: this creative pack type contains a single end card creative (square end card or end card pair) and one or two video creatives (one end card + 1-2 videos).
        * **playable**: this creative pack type contains one or two playable creatives.
        * **video and playable**: this creative pack type contains one or two video creatives and a single responsive playable.

        Each creative pack type requires different `creativeIds` which have to match with the given creative pack type.
        If the creatives referenced by the `creativeIds` do not match with the creative pack's `type` then the API
        will respond with `400` bad request.

      description: |
        This endpoint is used to create a campaign.

        In order to complete the campaign setup, take the following steps:
          1. You can <a href="#operation/advertise-createCreative">Upload Creatives</a> or use the old ones if you already have uploaded them.
          2. You can <a href="#operation/advertise-createCreativePack">Create Creative Pack</a> or use any approved creative pack you already have.
          3. You should <a href="#operation/advertise-assignCreativePack">Assign Creative Pack</a> to the campaign.
          4. Depending on the `goal` of your campaign you need to update CPI/ROAS/Retention bids by calling the right <a href="#tag/Bids">Bids endpoint</a>.
          5. Finally if you prepared all requirements you can change the `enabled` status by calling the <a href="#operation/advertise-updateCampaign">Update Campaign</a> endpoint.

        **Note**: The campaign must have the below prerequisites to go live:
          - At least one assigned and approved creative pack.
          - Tracking attribution links.
          - Specify countries you would like to advertise in.
          - The organization is required to have a budget and also, you can optionally <a href="#operation/advertise-createBudget">create</a> and <a href="#operation/advertise-replaceAssignedBudget">assign</a> the campaign-level budget.

        **Note**: Creating an iOS Campaign with CPI Billing type is not publicly available yet. If you want to try this feature, please reach out to your Unity partner or message us at unityads-support@unity3d.com.

          CPI campaigns are now target CPI campaigns while your campaign optimization goals,

          Bids are now Target CPI (tCPI) bids, the average amount you wish to pay per install. Target CPI is a
          bidding strategy that sets bids to help you get as many conversions as possible within a tight range of the
          target cost-per-install you set. This strategy automatically optimizes bidding for your ad each time it is
          eligible to appear. Target CPI (tCPI) bids are set the same way as CPI bids via APIs.

        Maximum bid value in dollars.

        Maximum bid is the intended upper limit for what you wish to pay for users depending on their
        expected value in your game. Your average effective cost per install (eCPI) could sometimes
        exceed this. Setting a low maximum bid may increase your ROAS since you are getting some users
        below their expected value, but it may restrict your volume since you are winning less impressions.
      example: '0.25'

        Base bid value in dollars.

        Base bid is the CPI you are willing to pay for the average users eligible for the campaign.
        It is not a minimum bid and your CPI for an individual user can be lower or higher than the
        base bid depending on the user's expected retention in your game.
      example: '0.75'

    advertise.retentionMaxBid:

        Maximum bid is the intended upper limit for what you wish to pay for users depending on their
        expected retention in your game. Your average effective cost per install (eCPI) could sometimes

        Unity recommends a minimum daily budget of $500 per country. Campaigns with less than $500 daily cap per country
        might not get any exposure due to budget restrictions.

        Having a low daily limit might result in overspend during the first few days, as the system might not be able to
        accurately predict the performance of your campaign.

        The daily limit is disabled when its value is set to `0`. Disabling the daily limit means that the spend
        is capped only by budget's total limit.

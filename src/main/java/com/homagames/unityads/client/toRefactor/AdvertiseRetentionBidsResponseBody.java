 * Unity Advertising Management API
 * # Introduction  This is the API documentation for the Unity Advertising Management API version 1 that allows you to programmatically manage your advertising campaigns through a RESTful API. The API currently offers endpoints that allow you to:  * Manage <a href=\"#tag/Apps\">Apps</a> * Manage <a href=\"#tag/Campaigns\">Campaigns</a> * Manage <a href=\"#tag/Bids\">Bids, Source Bids and Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) Bids</a> * Manage <a href=\"#tag/Budgets\">Budgets</a> * Manage <a href=\"#tag/Creatives\">Creatives</a> and <a href=\"#tag/Creative-Packs\">Creative Packs</a>  ## Getting Started  To get started, you will first need to create a service account and assign suitable roles for it. The <a href=\"#section/Authentication\">authentication section</a> has instructions for creating service accounts as well as for adding suitable authentication headers to your API requests. Note that you must be an Organization [Owner](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OrgsManagingyourOrganization.html) to manage service accounts.  The <a href=\"#section/General-Information\">general information section</a> describes shortly the entities found in the API, their relationships as well as the resource IDs used in the API.  The <a href=\"#tag/Apps\">endpoint section</a> contains documentation for the actual API endpoints.  The API endpoints are hosted at the following base URL: `https://services.api.unity.com`.  **How to Gain Access?**  **Note**: To be able to access the API and to create service accounts, your organization needs to have access granted to the Advertising Management API. Please contact your Unity Client Partner or email us at unityads-support@unity3d.com.  ## Contact  If you have any questions or feedback regarding the API you can reach out to us at unityads-support@unity3d.com.  # Versions and API Lifecycle  This section describes the past and upcoming changes to the API.  ## Change Log  * July 27, 2022: Added `billingType`-field to the request

The API may receive non-breaking changes without its version number being changed. Breaking changes are introduced only to new API versions.  Non-breaking changes can include (but are not limited to) for example:  * Adding new optional request headers * Adding new fields to the response * Adding new status codes to the response status codes list * Changing a required field to be optional * Changes to rate limits * Under-the-hood fixes that donâ€™t change the URL signature, the request format or the response format  Breaking changes can include (but are not limited to) for example:  * Changing the URL signature * Removing a field from the response * Adding a new required field to the request  ## Deprecation Policy  If a newer version of the API is released or if the service is discontinued, the API or one of its versions may be deprecated and eventually shutdown.  Deprecation of an API version will occur in 2 steps:  1. Unity's client partner or support team will email Organization owners, informing them of the new version's imminent    release and the current version's deprecation date. A deprecation notice will appear on the HTTP headers of any    deprecated API, and the documentation will be updated as such. 2. After 3 months of continued support for a deprecated version, Unity may cease support or shut down the version    entirely. A complete shutdown notice will be sent 1 month in advance.  # Authentication  To learn how to authenticate your requests, please visit the <a href=\"/docs#get-started\">Getting Started section</a>.  ## Roles and Permissions  The service account must have the relevant access to be able to call the APIs.

At the top level, the API has a resource that is called `App`. The `App` resource corresponds to a single app/game that has been published in a single app store. If you have published your app/game in more than one app store then you will have a separate `App` resource for each of those stores. Note that it is also possible to have more than one `App` resources that correspond to the same app/game in a store. The following diagram visualizes this relationship for a game called `My Game`:  ```mermaid   graph TD    StoreApp1(My Game for Platform X) --- AdsApp1   StoreApp2(My Game for Platform Y) --- AdsApp2    subgraph App Store 1     StoreApp1   end    subgraph App Store 2     StoreApp2   end    subgraph Unity Ads     AdsApp1(App) --- Resources1-1(\"...\")     AdsApp1 --- Resources1-2(\"...\")     AdsApp1 --- Resources1-3(\"...\")      AdsApp2(App) --- Resources2-1(\"...\")     AdsApp2 --- Resources2-2(\"...\")     AdsApp2 --- Resources2-3(\"...\")   end    classDef grey fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef white fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef green fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef blue fill:#1e60ab,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef red fill:#f33,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;    class StoreApp1,StoreApp2 grey   class AdsApp1,AdsApp2 white   class Resources1-1,Resources2-1 blue   class Resources1-2,Resources2-2 green   class Resources1-3,Resources2-3 red ```  Apps contain advertisement campaigns and resources related to those campaigns such as bids and creatives:  ```mermaid   graph TD    subgraph Unity Ads     App ---|has| Creative(\"Creative (Video, Playable or End Card)\")     App ---|has| CreativePack(Creative Pack)     App(App) ---|has| Campaign(Campaign)     CreativePack -.-|uses| Creative     Campaign -.-|uses| CreativePack     Campaign --- Bid(CPI bids and Source Bids)   end    classDef white fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef green fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef blue fill:#1e60ab,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;    class App white   class Campaign,Bid blue   class Creative,CreativePack green ```  Apps hold also further configuration that is utilized by the campaigns, such as budgets:  ```mermaid   graph TD    subgraph Unity Ads     App(App) ---|has| Budget(Budget)     App(App) ---|has| Campaign(Campaign)     Campaign -.-|uses| Budget   end    classDef white fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef green fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef blue fill:#1e60ab,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;   classDef red fill:#f33,color:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;    class App white   class Campaign blue   class Budget red ```  ## Glossary  This section provides a more detailed explanation of the vocabulary used in the API.  ### Apps and Campaigns  | Entity                     |  Description                                                                                                                    | |----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | [App](#tag/Apps)           | App that is published in an app store and contains a set of campaigns.

Open the [Acquire Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/acquire) 2. Select **Settings** from the navigation. 3. On the settings page, you will see two separate Organization ID fields. For the Advertising Management API, pick the value from the `Organization Core ID` field.  **Note**: The organizations are identified with two separate identifiers due to legacy reasons. The full name of the organization identifier used in the Advertising Management API is `Organization Core ID` but due to practical reasons it has been shortened to be `organizationId` in this API documentation.  ### How to Look Up campaignSetId and campaignId  To look up the `campaignSetId` and `campaignId`, the following options are available:  Apps and their respective campaignSetIds can be retrieved using the [List Apps](#operation/advertise-listApps) endpoint. In the API response, the `id`-field holds the campaignSetId. Likewise, campaigns and their respective campaignIds can be retrieved using the [List Campaigns](#operation/advertise-listCampaigns) endpoint.  The campaignSetId and campaignId identifiers are also available via the [Advertising Statistics API](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/stats-api) where you can find them under the columns `campaign set id` and `campaign id`, respectively.  It is also possible to find all the identifiers from the URLs of the Unity Acquire dashboard. First, open the [dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/acquire/) and then click **Apps** and choose an app and a campaign to view. After that the IDs are visible in the URL in following spots: `https://dashboard.unity3d.com/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/acquire/campaign-sets/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>`  ## Rate Limits  The API has rate limiting in place. The maximum number of requests per IP address is limited to 6 requests per second and to 4000 requests per 30 minutes.  Additionally all operations that modify resources (`PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) are limited so that it is possible to modify a single resource per endpoint at most 30 times per 30 minutes or at most once per a second. This means that for example the CPI bids of a single campaign can be updated at most 30 times inside a 30 minute time interval. The endpoints don't share the quota, so it is possible to do also other updates (e.g. source bids) to that same campaign during that same time interval.  Similarly operations that create resources (`POST`) are limited so that it is possible to create at most 30 new resources per endpoint under a single app or campaign per 30 minutes or at most once per a second. This means that it is possible to for example upload at most 30 creatives into a single app within a 30 minute interval. During that same time window it is possible to also create other resources or apply updates to the campaigns that are under the app. Each endpoint has its own quota.  If you need to update multiple campaigns fast, you can do that. It is for example possible to update CPI bids of hundreds of campaigns within a short time interval, as long as the number of requests stays in the overall bounds of max 6 requests per second and max 4000 requests per 30 minutes.  The API responds with `429` HTTP status code if the rate limit is exceeded.  **Quick Reference**  | What is limited          |  How many requests are allowed per second  | How many requests are allowed per 30 minutes | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | |--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | All requests             | 6                                          | 4000                                         | Takes all requests into account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | | `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` | 1                                          | 30                                           | Applied per `Budget`, `Campaign`, `Creative` or `Creative Pack` for each endpoint separately.                                                                                                                                                                      | | `POST`                   | 1                                          | 30                                           | Applied per `App` per endpoint for those resources that are directly under the `App` such as `Budgets` and `Campaigns`. If the resource in question is under `Campaign`, such as `Creative Pack Assignment` then the limit is applied per `Campaign` per endpoint. |  ## Response Compression  The API supports response compression. The responses are compressed if either `Accept-Encoding: gzip` or `Accept-Encoding: deflate` header is provided in the request.

This article covers the following steps:  * [Overview](#section/Guides/Creatives/Overview) * [Step 1: Upload Your Creatives](#section/Guides/Creatives/Step1) * [Step 2: Create a Creative Pack](#section/Guides/Creatives/Step2) * [Step 3: Assign a Creative Pack to a Campaign](#section/Guides/Creatives/Step3)  ### <a name=\"section/Guides/Creatives/Overview\"></a>Overview  The ad assets (files) such as videos, playables and end cards are managed using two concepts called `Creatives` and `Creative Packs`. Creatives directly hold your creative files while creative packs combine 1-3 creatives into a pack that can be assigned to one or more campaigns.  The process for creating and assigning creative packs to campaigns is as follows:  ```mermaid   graph LR   Upload[Upload creatives] --> Pack[Create a creative pack] --> Assign[Assign the creative pack<br>to a campaign]   classDef black fill:#000,color:#fff,stroke:#ddd,stroke-width:1px,line-height:21px;   class Upload,Pack,Assign black   click Upload \"./advertise.html#operation/advertise-createCreative\"   click Pack \"./advertise.html#operation/advertise-createCreativePack\" ```  ### <a name=\"section/Guides/Creatives/Step1\"></a>Step 1: Upload Your Creatives  You can upload your creatives by using the [Create Creative](#operation/advertise-createCreative) endpoint.  The following creative assets can be uploaded currently through the API:  * **Square end card**: this creative type contains a single square shaped 800â€‰Ã—â€‰800 image. * **End card pair**: this creative type contains a 600â€‰Ã—â€‰800 portrait image and a 800â€‰Ã—â€‰600 landscape image. * **Portrait video**: this creative type contains a 9:16 portrait video. * **Landscape video**: this creative type contains a 16:9 landscape video. * **Playable**: this creative type contains an MRAID 2.0 compliant HTML document in a landscape, portrait or responsive orientation. [See full playable guidelines](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide#playables).  Usually you call the `Create Creative` endpoint once for each file you wish to upload. The only exception to this is the end card pair creative which includes both portrait and landscape images in one creative.  #### Upload a Video  Below is an example how the upload endpoint can be called using the command line command `curl`. To try it out, replace the `/path/to/your/file/myPortraitVideo.mp4` with your local video file path and replace `<ORGANIZATION_ID>`, `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>` and `<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>` with values matching your organization and app.  ``` curl --verbose \\      --form 'creativeInfo={\"name\": \"My Portrait Video\", \"language\": \"en\", \"video\": {\"fileName\":\"myPortraitVideo.mp4\"}}' \\      --form \"videoFile=@/path/to/your/file/myPortraitVideo.mp4\" \\      --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\      https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives ```  Once the upload has completed successfully, you will receive a HTTP `201` response with a response payload such as below:  ```JSON   {     \"id\": \"5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1\",     \"name\": \"My Portrait Video\",     \"language\": \"en\",     \"type\": \"portraitVideo\",     \"createdAt\": \"2020-12-11T12:19:29.004Z\",     \"status\": \"uploaded\"   } ```  #### Upload a Square End Card  Uploading a square end card works in similar fashion as uploading videos but you'll need to adjust the request in the following way:  1. Adjust the `creativeInfo` to contain a `squareEndCard` field instead of a `video` field. 2. Instead of passing the file in a `videoFile` field, pass the file in a field called `squareEndCardFile`.  Example: ``` curl --verbose \\      --form 'creativeInfo={\"name\":\"My End Card\", \"language\":\"en\", \"squareEndCard\": {\"fileName\":\"mySquareEndCard.jpeg\"}}' \\      --form \"squareEndCardFile=@/path/to/your/file/mySquareEndCard.jpeg\" \\      --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\      https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives ```  #### Upload an End Card Pair  Uploading an end card pair works in similar fashion as uploading videos and square end card but you'll need to include both end card files in the request:  ``` curl --verbose \\    --form 'creativeInfo={\"name\":\"My End Card Pair\", \"language\":\"en\", \"portraitEndCard\": {\"fileName\":\"myPortraitEndCard.jpeg\" }, \"landscapeEndCard\": {\"fileName\":\"myLandscapeEndCard.jpeg\"}}' \\    --form \"portraitEndCardFile=@/path/to/your/file/600x800.jpeg\" \\    --form \"landscapeEndCardFile=@/path/to/your/file/800x600.jpeg\" \\    --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\    https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creatives ```  #### Creative Status  After having been uploaded, all new creatives undergo a [content moderation process](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide#moderating-creatives) to ensure that they adhere to Unity's advertising [content policies](https://unity3d.com/legal/advertising-content-policy). Before entering the moderation queue the video creatives go through a processing state that can take few minutes.  You can check the latest status of the uploaded creative with [Get Creative](#operation/advertise-getCreative) endpoint.  Creatives can be added into a creative pack immediately after they have been uploaded. It isn't necessary to wait for the moderation to complete. However, a creative pack can go live only after all its creatives have passed the moderation.  ### <a name=\"section/Guides/Creatives/Step2\"></a>Step 2: Create a Creative Pack  Once you've uploaded your creatives, you can use [Create Creative Pack](#operation/advertise-createCreativePack) endpoint to create a creative pack out of them. A creative pack combines 1-3 creatives into one entity that can be assigned to one or more campaigns.  The following creative combinations are allowed when creating a creative pack through the API:  * Portrait video  + end card * Landscape video + end card * Portrait video  + landscape video + end card * Responsive playable * Portrait playable * Landscape playable * Portrait playable + landscape playable  While only one video or playable is required, uploading one for each orientation yields better optimization. When a creative pack contains both, Unityâ€™s valuation algorithm selects the best orientation to display.  Below is an example that creates a creative pack that contains one portrait video (with ID `5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1`) and one square end card (with ID `5feb40a6ff3d91a3af53c678`):  ``` curl --verbose \\      --request POST \\      --data '{\"name\": \"Portrait video with square end card\", \"creativeIds\": [\"5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1\", \"5feb40a6ff3d91a3af53c678\"], \"type\": \"video\"}' \\      --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\      --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\      https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/creative-packs ```  Replace the `creativeIds`, `<ORGANIZATION_ID>`, `<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>` and `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>` with values that match your app and organization.  For a successful request, the response HTTP status code is `201` and the response body follows following format:  ```JSON {   \"id\": \"5feb4574ff3d91a3af53c67e\",   \"name\": \"Video with end card\",   \"type\": \"video\",   \"creativeIds\": [       \"5fd363cf5d84aa0ed76956b1\",       \"5feb40a6ff3d91a3af53c678\"   ] } ```  ### <a name=\"section/Guides/Creatives/Step3\"></a>Step 3: Assign a Creative Pack to a Campaign  To assign a creative pack to your campaign, use the <a href=\"#operation/advertise-assignCreativePack\">assign Creative Pack endpoint</a>.  If your creative pack's ID is for example `5f15703772f10b00138f6d8d`, you can assign it to your campaign with a POST request:  ``` curl --verbose \\      --request POST \\      --data '{\"id\": \"5f15703772f10b00138f6d8d\"}' \\      --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\      --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\      https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/assigned-creative-packs ```  The currently assigned creative packs can be listed with a GET query:  ``` curl --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\      https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/assigned-creative-packs ```  The response contains a list of creative pack IDs.  A campaign must contain at least one approved creative pack in order to go live. If your live campaign includes a mix of approved and pending creative packs, the pending ones will automatically run once approved.  To unassign a creative pack from a campaign, use the <a href=\"#operation/advertise-unassignCreativePack\">unassign Creative Pack endpoint</a>.  You can unassign a creative pack with a DELETE query that includes the creative pack's ID in the URL:  ``` curl --verbose \\      --request DELETE \\      --header \"Authorization: Basic <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS>\" \\      https://services.api.unity.com/advertise/v1/organizations/<ORGANIZATION_ID>/apps/<CAMPAIGN_SET_ID>/campaigns/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/assigned-creative-packs/<ASSIGNED_CREATIVE_PACK_ID> ```
